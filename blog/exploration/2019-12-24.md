What makes a heart flow like a river other than a waterfall? In this concept work, Andreas Rocha manages to express depth using a combination of desaturation and pathing, using the waterfall as an observable start or end depending on how you look at it. The variety of elements is also another spectacle in this art: the mist, the rocky cliffs, the trees...

This is a good example of how we can create a 3D perspective using a one color range only. When you take a closer look at this project you can appreciate the different textures that can be achieved with a single color. Thanks to this picture we can see that sometimes the less is the better.

Shawn Kassian show us that even for a beginner it's possible to create 3D masterpieces. Shawn Kassian had a great idea and thanks to the Unreal Engine Market and its facilities it came true. The way Shawn Kassian used the lights to make this picture deeper it's a good example of what can we create with a little bit of creativity and knowledge of our abilities.

World of Warcraft is one of the biggest platforms in the world and it has changed the course of the lifes of many people around the world. And art is all about mixing our experiences with what we want to see. Stanton Feng has turned a familiar picture to something more personal and epic using the experience from Blizzard's masterpiece. This picture takes the viewer almost there inside the noisy and crowded enter of the Orgrimmar city of orcs from World of Warcraft.
